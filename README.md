## Analysis of spin-wave dispersion in magnonic structure
A cluster of .ovf (OOMMF vector format) files containing 
spatio-temporal information of spin-waves are post-processed
to plot the spin-wave dispersion curve. The post-processing 
algorithm is adopted from [[1]](#1).

Additionally, space-time variation of spin-waves can be also
be plotted and theoretical calculation of dispersion function
and group velocity of the lowest order mode of three classes of
spin-waves namely Backward volume spin-waves (BVSWs), Forward
volume spin-waves (FVSWs) and Surface spin-waves (SSW) are done.
